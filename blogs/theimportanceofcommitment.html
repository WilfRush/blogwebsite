      <h2 class="blog-title">The Psychology of Golf: Bryson DeChambeau and the Importance of 100% Commitment</h2>
      <h3 class="blog-date">12th July 2020</h3>

      <p>Bryson DeChambeau silenced a lot of people after his win last week at the Rocket Mortgage Classic. Previously
        he had been a top 10 machine, notching up 3 in the last 3 week since the PGA tour returned from the lockdown ,
        notching up 3 top 10’s in the last 3 starts since the PGA Tour returned from lockdown. But last week he claimed
        a 3 shot win over Matthew Wolff which was his first win in almost 2 years.</p>
      <p>Bryson Pre-Lockdown vs Bryson Post-Lockdown was very different indeed. Almost 20 pounds gained and 100s of
        protein-shakes later Bryson can now reach club-head speeds of 139mph. 9mph more than the Cameron Champ who
        averages at around 130mph club-head speed.</p>
      <p>Rewind to late 2019, a Bryson that was 40 pounds lighter stated that he wanted to get bigger. He assured people
        that after the Christmas break he would look like a different person. He wasn’t wrong! Of Course many were quick
        to criticize him saying how changing his body could be detrimental to his game. After all, in the past players
        have ruined their game after hitting the gym. Just take David Duval as an example: David was former world No1
        and won 13 PGA Tour events including the Open Championship in 2001 at Royal Lytham. But after hitting the gym he
        developed back and shoulder problems which plagued his golf game. After being one of the best players in the
        game, David slumped to 80th and 211th on the PGA tour in 2002 and 2003 respectively. After that David did play,
        but never to the level he was at in his prime. </p>
      <p>Despite all the criticism Bryson did what he said he was going to do and in truth, it is probably one of the
        best decisions he could have made. Dechambeau has always done things HIS way, from the Same-length clubs to the
        intense calculations he performs when working out what shot to play. He has never been scared to go against the
        grain and raise some eyebrows. </p>
      <p>By doing things his own way he has to stay 100% committed to what he is trying to achieve due to the complexity
        of it all. It’s this mindset that has enabled him to produce such results from his gym ‘bulk up’.</p>
      <p>Having full commitment is incredibly important in golf, it’s the idea that a bad shot you have committed to, is
        always better than a bad shot you didn't commit to.

        What exactly is commitment though may ask? Well the dictionary definition is; “a promise of firm decision to do
        something”.

        Using this definition in a golf setting could be this: When picking a shot to play, you are 100% and confident
        that it is the right shot, and you are free from doubt of it not being the correct shot to play. You may ask,
        “It’s impossible for me to pick the correct shot every time?”. However the beauty of golf, and in fact life is
        that being correct 100% of the time is impossible. The goal is to believe you are right, so that every decision
        you choose to make, you commit to that decision, creating “tunnel vision”. Without the fear of being wrong.</p>

      <p>FEAR in golf is one of the biggest killers, it’s when you walk onto the tree worrying about what could go
        wrong, rather than you focusing on what you want to happen.
        For example, during Bryson's “bulk up” he could have been fearful that what he was doing might not be helping his
        game. But in truth, he wasn’t. So he believed fully that what he was doing was only going to be beneficial to
        his game. Therefore he was 100% committed and without
        fear.</p>
      <p>The Placebo Effect- The placebo effect is a term often used in healthcare. It's when there is a beneficial
        effect from a placebo treatment (fake treatment). The benefit is therefore put down to the patient's belief in
        the treatment. This shows that having strong belief in what you are trying to achieve is so important,
        especially in golf.</p>

      <p>Although the gains and benefits from Bryson “bulk up” are quite clear to see,with the 360 yard average drives
        and 139mph club head. I think that part of Bryson's success and better golf can be attributed to the fact that
        he had 100% belief in his methods. Whether or not this would have been a realistic expectation of not is a
        different question, but he because he believed it would help him and he had no FEAR, he succeeded. </p>
