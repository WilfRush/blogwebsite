    <h2 class="blog-title">3 ways to improve YOUR practise NOW</h2>
    <h3 class="blog-date">7th July 2020</h3>
    <p>Most golfers likely don't get as much out of their practise as they should, so they will never be able to reach the
    level they think they are capable of. And in some cases they could be doing more damage than good. So I am giving
    you three ways to make YOUR practise more productive. Also there is a short game drill at the end I've created which
    combines these 3 methods.</p>

    <p><h4>VARIED CONDITIONS</h4>• The idea of varying the environment and conditions relate to how the conditions and environment
    change on the golf course. During a round you are never faced with the same shot twice. So in order to perform best
    whilst on the course it is important to create the same sort of varying conditions you would be faced on the course.
    A simple way of doing this would be to take a 15 yard chip shot. Instead of hitting all your balls from one spot you
    should take 5 balls each from an uphill lie, downhill lie, ball-above feet lie and then one will the ball below your
    feet. Although this is a simple example, it will still provide a much more productive practise session.</p>

    <p><h4>SPACE-BETWEEN SHOTS</h4>• This is fairly self explanatory, having time between each shot in your practise session will
    drastically improve your focus throughout you practise session. By doing this your mind can regain concentration. A
    way of implementing this would be to add eg/. 45 seconds(not including practise swings) in between each shot during
    a range session. Take this time to take some deep breaths so you can find balance and a point of calm. Doing this
    focuses you so your brain is far more able to change it’s neural pathways, so that you can learn new shots and
    implement swing change faster.</p>

    <p><h4>CHALLENGE YOURSELF</h4>• In to grow and get better at anything you need to feel uncomfortable. Being uncomfortable enables
    you to learn and perform better in pressure situations. By challenging yourself you can create discomfort; adding a
    consequence to every shot is a sure-fire way to challenge yourself and create the same sort of pressured environment
    you might face on the course.This consequence could be as simple as just not leaving until you hole the putt, or
    doing 5 press-up if you don’t hit the green. But as long as it creates pressure and discomfort, it is good enough.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 40px ; margin-top: 40px;">Here is a Short game Practise drill you can do which involves these three things:</h3>

    <p>• 3 different locations to hit balls from, ideally a chip from the fairway, one from the rough and one bunker shot.
    This creates VARIED ENVIRONMENT for hitting shots in.</p>

    <p>• Hit 3 balls from each location. Between each shot takes 30 seconds to assess, and decide what kind of shot you are
    going to play. Also carry out your normal pre-shot routine. Again this allows you to have SPACE-BETWEEN SHOTS, so
    you and mentally prepared for each shot.</p>

    <p>• The aim for this drill is to get 2 out of the 3 balls, at each location within 5ft. So if you don't get at least 2
    out of 3 you have to rePick start the whole drill. And what's more you can’t leave until you have completed. This
    will CHALLENGE YOU, create discomfort and pressure as you know you can’t leave until you complete in.</p>

    <p>• Obviously if this is too hard then you can change it according to your skill level. Although don't make it too easy
    as this drill is meant to be a challenge.</p>

    <p>• This level of difficulty would be good for a golfer who has a handicap between 3 and 10.</p>
