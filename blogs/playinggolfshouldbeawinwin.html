            <p>Having the right mental approach to a round of golf is just as important as having the correct physical
                approach.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">How to have the right mental approach?</h3>
            <p>Let me introduce you to “win, win”. It's fairly self-explanation but it means you should play golf with
                the thought of it being a win-win situation. When playing your shots you should believe that whatever
                happens, you have won. This is because if you hit a good shot you’ve won, and if you hit a bad shot then
                you have also won because it’s a chance to learn and grow. Once you are able to program this mindset
                into your head then you can start playing golf without the fear of failure, and you will start looking
                forward to playing your golf shots as you will not be fearing the worst outcome.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">The Importance of viewing failiures as wins:</h3>
            <p>In order to install this mindset within your head, you need to be able to view all your failures as wins.
                Otherwise you will never have the “win win” mindset and you will always be subconsciously fearful of bad
                shots.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">Tiger Woods once said:</p>
            <h4 style="margin-top: 30px;">"There is no such thing as a setback. The lessons I learned today I will apply tomorrow, and I will be
                better."</h4>

            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">By viewing bad shots as learning experiences and opportunities to get better you can properly view them
                as a wins, NOT failures. Like Tiger said, “There is no such thing as a setback...”.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">How to view your failures as wins?</h3>
            <h5 style="margin-top: 30px;">Growth Mindset VS Fixed Mindset:</h5>
            <p>Growth mindset. A growth mindset is when you have the belief that you can develop your talents and
                abilities through hard work. By having this mindset you will be more willing to learn, and therefore you
                will be more able to accept your bad shots as opportunities to get better. So you then easily accept
                them and “wins”.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">Fixed Mindset. A fixed mindset is when you have the belief that talents and abilities are unalterable
                traits, ones that can never be improved. It’s important to understand that you WON’T be able to achieve
                the “win, win” mindset with this belief system.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">So my advice is: Open your mind to the possibility of improvement and DON’T be stubborn to learning in
                different ways.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Taking Notes:</h3>
            <p>A good way to practise the “win win” mindset is to take notes after or during your rounds. In a notepad
                write down the bad shots you had within that round. Now, for each of those shots write down what you did
                wrong. Then write down ONE thing that could be done better next time. Then try and implement these
                things into your game the next time you play. Not only will this help you improve your overall golf
                game, it will help you better understand that bad shots/failures are opportunities to get better and
                therefore they are "WINS".</p>
