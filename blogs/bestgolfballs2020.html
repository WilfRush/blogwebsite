      <h3 class="blog-date">10th July 2020</h3>
      <p>Selecting the correct golf ball for your golf game can be tricky, especially when there are so many different
        types out there. Many factors can be taken into account, such as your skill level, what feel you want and how
        much spin you want. So to make it easier for you, here is a list of some of the best golf balls of 2020.</p>

      <p>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">BEST OVERALL GOLF BALL OF 2020:</h2>
        <h3>Titliest ProV1 & ProV1x</h3>
        Both of these are premium golf balls at the top of the price range, but for good reason. In essence the ProV1/x
        are meant to maximise short game spin & control whilst maximising long game distance and low spin. The two balls
        differ slightly:

        <ul>
          <li>Extraordinary distance with consistent flight</li>
          <li>Very low long game spin</li>
          <li>Penertrating trajectory</li>
          <li>Drop and Stop™ short game control</li>

          <li>Very low long game spin</li>
          <li>Penertrating trajectory</li>

          <li>Very soft feel</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">In truth an average golfer likely won’t feel much difference in performance between the two balls. So it’s
          really preference based on which ball you would want. In my opinion the Pro V1 is for a golfer wanting a
          softer feel, and the Pro V1x is for a golfer wanting a higher ball flight. But don’t get me wrong these two
          balls are undoubtedly the two best on the market right now: in the 2018/19 PGA tour season players using ProV1
          and ProV1x golf balls racked up 18 wins. Meanwhile it’s nearest competitor Taylormade had only 5. So if you
          don’t mind the high price, then the ProV’s are definitely worth the buy, and will undoubtedly help your game.

        <h3><a class="product-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07WWWSFY9/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B07WWWSFY9&linkCode=as2&tag=wilfrush-21&linkId=17baa3b31a691241e2d797404b2c6422">Srixon AD333</a></h3>

        <p>The AD333 is a premium, lower-compression golf ball that delivers superior, balanced performance for golfers
          who demand exceptional distance, feel and greenside control, while being at a lower price point.</p>
        <h4>Features of the Srixon AD333</h4>
        <ul>
          <p>
            <li>NEW FastLayer Core</li>
            <p>Starts soft in the center and gradually becomes firm around its outer edge, FastLayer delivers
              exceptional feel and ball speed for maximum distance.</p>
          </p>

          <p>
            <li>NEW Spin Skin with SeRM</li>
            <p>A coating with flexible molecular bonds digs deep into wedge and iron grooves, maximizing spin for more
              control and more stopping power.</p>
          </p>

          <p>
            <li>338 Speed Dimple Pattern</li>
            <p>Less drag and more lift boosts overall distance and accuracy, even in the toughest wind conditions.</p>
          </p>

        </ul>
        <p>I believe a good golf ball for beginners is one that performs well while being a lower price. The low price
          is important as beginner golfers are bound to lose a few balls so in order to not break the bank the cheaper
          balls are ideal.</p>

        <p>The Callaway Chrome Soft golf ball is used on Tour by the likes of Phil Mickelson, Xander Schauffle and Marc
          Leishman. This is a tour-level golf ball that gives long distance, great feel, and exceptional spin control
          from tee-to-green whilst being great value for money.</p>
        <h4>Features of the Callaway Chrome Soft</h4>
        <ul>

          <p>
            <li>Larger Graphene-Infused Dual SoftFast Core For Increased Distance</li>
            <p>A faster core for longer distance. The significantly larger inner core creates higher launch and lower
              spin. And the thinner, firmer outer core is reinforced with Graphene for better durability and more wedge
              spin.
            </p>
          </p>

          <p>
            <li>Consistent Speed and Penetrating Ball Flight From a New High-Speed Mantle System</li>
            <p>New proprietary Ionomer blend creates more efficient energy transfer from the Dual SoftFast Core for
              faster ball speed. The compounded additives improve consistency and durability, and the stiff mantle
              allows for ideal spin on wedge shots.
            </p>
          </p>

          <p>
            <li>Incredible Feel and Spin Control From a Thinner Urethane Cover</li>
            <p>Thinner, more resilient cover promotes increased ball speed, and generates lower spin on full shots while
              maintaining high spin and soft feel around the green.
            </p>
          </p>

          <p>
            <li>Longer Distance and Consistent Trajectory From Optimized Aero Design</li>
            <p>Reduces drag for increased overall distance, with a higher ball flight for optimum trajectory.
            </p>
          </p>

        </ul>
        <p>For Tour-level performance at an affordable price then the Callaway Chrome Soft the ball for you. The only
          drawback is this ball could be too soft for you liking.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 80px;">FAQs</h2>

      <p>
        <h3>Are ProV1/x balls Soft?</h3>
        <p>YES, both the V1 and V1x are soft golf balls. The V1 however is the softer of the two.</p>
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>What is the best golf ball for a 10 handicapper?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t mind the high price, the Titleist ProV1 or ProV1x is the best, however for slightly cheaper you
          can get more or less the same tour-level performance for the Callaway Chrome Soft.
        </p>
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>What Golf balls do Tour Pros use?</h3>
        <p>Titleist ProV1 and V1x make up about 60-70% of the ball playing each week on the PGA tour. With the rest a
          mix of Taylormade TP5/TP5x, Callaway Chrome Soft, Srixon Z-Star and Bridgestone TOUR BXS.</p>
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>What happens if I'm still not sure what ball to use?</h3>
        <p>A good way to work out what golf ball is right for you is to have a ball fitting. A ball fitting will consist
          of you trying out a number of different balls and hitting them on TrackMan so you can see the distance, spin
          and launch angle you're getting. Your fitter will then advise you on what ball will be best depending on these
          factors. Ball fittings are often free of charge as well so I would highly recommend you to have one
