    <h3 class="blog-date">8th July 2020</h3>
    <p>They say golf is 60% mental and 40% physical. So mastering your mind is possibly one of the biggest priorities you
    should have when trying to improve. I assume you have often been told to “stay in the moment”, “try not to care” and
    even the famous “once shot at time”. In all honesty these are all good ways to upgrade your mental game but as we
    all know with golf, it’s all easier said than done.</p>

    <p>As golf is a game of such fine margins, having a stable mental state is very important. Having a stable mental
    state,is simply being in the present. NOT dwelling on the three putt you had on the previous green, and NOT worrying
    about the scary tee shot on the next. This way, you can properly focus on your shots without the other distractions
    in your head.</p>

    <p>Ever heard of Louis Oosthuizen? Winner of the 2010 Open Championship at St Andrews(Home of Golf) and current world
    number 21. Well in his Open Championship win he drew a red spot on his golf glove with a sharpie. This red spot was
    significant as every time he looked down he saw it. So every time he played a shot, he would see it and it would
    immediately focus him on the shot. So for Louis there was no “external noise”, and 100% of his thoughts were on that
    shot. Well not 100%; that is just about impossible. But you could bet your house on that it was fairly close. I
    wasn’t so much the colour, or shape of the red spot. It was the fact that there was something there to focus his
    mind on, so that he was completely in the present moment.</p>

    <p>So I'm not expecting you to go and draw a red spot on your golf glove. But I believe you should find/create
    something similar so that you can focus easier and be more in the present moment when you next play golf.</p>

    <p>Try it out and see how it goes. You might just win an Open Championship!</p>
