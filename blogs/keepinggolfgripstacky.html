            <p>Having slippery grips can be very inconvenient and could be detrimental to your game. You may consider
                buying some new grips however with a simple trick you can make your old golf grips tacky again. And you
                can play with confidence with the knowledge that you can easily keep hold of your golf club. This is the
                best way to clean golf grips, and make them more tacky.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">You Need:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Washing up liquid</li>
                <li>A scrubbing brush</li>
                <li>Some hot water</li>
                <li>A towel(ideally a golf towel)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Method:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Run your grip under hot water for around 10secs until it is fully soaked in the water.</li>
                <li>Apply a generous amount of washing up liquid to your scrubbing brush. Don’t worry about putting too
                    much on brush, it won’t ruin your grip.</li>
                <li>Scrub your grip with brush for about 1-2 minutes until a thick lather has formed.</li>
                <li>Then whilst running the grip under the hot water, continue to scrub the grip for another 1-2
                    minutes. Making sure all the washing liquid is gone. Don’t be afraid to scrub your grip for even
                    longer, as this will only make it more grippy. It’s important that you make sure to get all the
                    washing up liquid off the grip, otherwise the residue will be left on the grip and It will be
                    slippery.
                </li>
                <li>Finally dry the grip with a towel until it is completely dry. Again make sure you dry it completely
                    otherwise some residue could be left on the grip which will leave it slippery.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h5 style="margin-top: 30px;">Will this method ruin my grip?</h5>
            <p>Absolutely NOT. The use of washing up liquid will clean the grip and remove any dirt. Then by scrubbing the grip, any dull layer of grip will be removed and scrubbed away so that the tacky part of the grip is left. Leaving you with a “brand new” grip.</p>
