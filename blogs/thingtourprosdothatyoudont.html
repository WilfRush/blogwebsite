    <h2 class="blog-title">Things Tour Pros do, that YOU don't</h2>
    <h3 class="blog-date">6th July 2020</h3>
    <p>It’s no secret that there is a huge gap between tour players and the average club golfer. There are many reasons for
    this such as their ball striking, ability hole putts, and how far they hit the ball. These however come with
    thousands of hours of practise and hardwork. These are however a few things you can do instantly to bridge the gap
    between YOU and a Tour player.</p>

    <p><h4>CLEAN YOUR GROOVES</h4>• Have you notice that after every shot the pro hands his club to the caddie and then the caddie
    cleans it. Dirty groove, especially in your wedges could be massively reducing the amount of spin you're generating.
    Therefore reduce the control you have around the green. Also studies show that you can lose up to 1,500rpm of spin
    on a full swing. This could be the difference between being 5ft from the pin, or off the back of the green.
    A simple groove cleaner like this can make all the difference.</p>

    <p><h4>CLEAN YOUR BALL</h4>• This then leads me into the 2nd thing that tour pros do that you don't. When on the green, mark and
    clean your ball. Who knows what could be on your ball, but one thing we do know is that a clean ball will give you a
    more consistent roll on the green, and likely make you hole more putts.
    Golf Towels like these are perfect for cleaning your golf balls, and golf clubs aswell.</p>

    <p><h4>AIM SMALL, MISS SMALL</h4>• When pro picks a target they often pick out the smallest possible target they can find,
    whether it is a blade of grass, or an on course bin. This will concentrate their attention massively, so they focus
    it on one place, not a large area. A more focused golfer, is a better golfer. Which therefore alludes to the idea of
    AIM SMALL, MISS SMALL. So try this when you next play; pick out the smallest possible target you can when playing a
    shot. After all, the great Ben Hogan once said: “golf is a game of misses,the guy who misses the best will win”.</p>

    <p>These tips won't turn you into tiger woods overnight but they will help you think and play like a tour pro, which
    can only help knock shots off your scores.</p>
